		<h1>Virtual World</h1>
		<p>Check out this cool virtual abstract universe world I made!</p>

		    You can navigate using the mouse/touch. When you click it, you'll move forward!
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    As you can see, this is an ~abstract~ universe, so as you explore, you may find yourself encountering a box, a cylinder, a torus knot, some spheres (as planets) a ring (on saturn), and other shapes!
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    The planets are colored with bitmapped files (jpg/pnj), so as to give it a planetary vibe!
		  </li>

		    Saturn is inseparable from it's ring! This is a composite object. This is how they work. They just, like, stick together as a big object. Like those couples in relationships where they just merge into 1 person. But these aren't people, these are composite objets. They have not fallen in love, they have been programed to be together. By me. I am cupid.

		    Touch the Earth. Turn up your volume.

		    BB is a 3D model.

		    Those random floating things are objects, specially made, named "thing". These things move randomly according to perlin noise. Fun!
		  </li>

		     Also touch Jupiter. MAGIC!

        And look at that pretty sky thing for the background. But Jenny, wait, aren't the planets suppose to be in space, you ask? Well, what if space is so big, that we're just some speck of raindrops in another world? Bet you haven't thought about it like that before. Well, I have. And this is that other world. Also I couldn't find good equirectangular pictures of space. But that's besides the point. And look at how cool this world it. There's like, moutains and stuff.

        ALSO! *BONUS* THE PLANETS SPIN! Because they're planets.
